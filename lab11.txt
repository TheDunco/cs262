In homeStack.js, the formatter suggested I move a multi-line tag to one line.

In mapScreen.js, eslint had me change all quotes to single quotes, 
    delete dangling commas, add spaces after //'s and {**}s and between function names and ()'s,
    deleted unused imports
    
In interiorScreen it made me do all of the above including switching vars to lets and consts

For the loginScreen it had me do everything listed above, but is yelling at me because of the <link> tag even 
    though it works just fine.
This is the only suggestion I didn't take; I like the cleaner and easier to type look that this format offers.
