Exercise 1.1
These are my miscilaneous ideas, but I think I have a pretty good idea of a project I want to work on later... 1. An app that reads the Terms of Service for you and lets you know if there are any dubious things in it 2. An app that basically runs your life for you; plans meals, time manages, suggests activities...

    I would really like to work on Haram's project with Joel Muyskens, Alex Johnson, and Hyechan Jun
    We think it will be a really interesting and helpful project that's managable with us working together.

    It could include AR elements or mapping algorithms. We already have access to PDF's of building and campus layouts I believe
